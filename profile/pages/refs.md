   #### Summary CWI Machine learning theory [Bootcamp](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~wmkoolen/MLT_Sem23/bootcamp.html#Ronald) 14 and 15 February 2023
   No recordings available
   ##### Day 1
   ###### Johannes Schmidt-Hieber
   - Biological neurons: Receive signals (spike time) instead of tensors.
   - Hebbian learning: Adapt a neuron's weight depending on how long ago the other neuron fired the message.

   ###### Frans Oliehoek
   - Reinforcement learning basics, Q-learning.
   - SDM: Sequential Decision Making.
   - MPD: Markov Decision Process.
   - Monte carlo research trees.
   - Intuition of how AlphaGo works.

   ###### Gabriele Cesa: Group equivariant deep learning
   - **Groups**: Framework to apply different transformations to the input (e.g. rotations, translations, reflections).
   - Steerable CNNs. 
   - Group equivariance is not suitable for scale transformations.

   ###### Bob Williamson (Lecture): Foundations of machine learning systems

   ###### Emilie Kaufmann (Lecture): A Tale of Two Non-parametric Bandit Problems

   ##### Day 2
   ###### Tim van Erven: Formal Results in Explainable Machine Learning
   - Explainable AI are mostly *local* (for a given data point) *post-hoc* (after the model has been trained).
   - Most of explainable AI methods: linearization of the function at point $x$ such that the coefficients give the importance of each of the parameteres. 
   - Two examples of methodologies: Gradient-based explanaiton, LIME. 

   ###### Ivo Stoepker: Anomaly detection

   ###### Jaron Sanders: Detecting clusters in time series
   - Stochastic Block Models (SBMs)

   ###### Ronald de Wolf: Tutorial on Quantum Machine Learning
   - Quantum/classical, optimizer/data combinations.
   - Learner is Quantum (Optimizer) specially interesting. 
   - **Quantum linear Algebra**: unsupervised learning. Output is quantum, sometimes dequantizable, usually assumes quantum input. Applies PCA: find eigenvectors in quantum notation.

   ###### Mathias Staudigl: Learning in Games
